# openag_jbt1
211-2936 Farnell 135-104LAG-J01, NTC, Axial, 100K. Analog thermistor 
temperature sensor driver for The V2 OpenagInItiative Food Bot.

The jbt1 simple home made thermistor temperature sensor requires two components.
A 120kohm resistor connected to the afore mentioned thermistor in series between
ground and +5v.

The analog value is taken from the junction of the resistor and the thermistor
by the signal wire connection.

This code is for the openag food bot air_temperature readout.
